# FFNN - a very simple feedforward neural network library

Not useful yet, still a WIP.

## TODO

- [ ] Move initialization to the builder
- [ ] Backward propagation
- [ ] Batched backprop
- [ ] Multiple activation functions
- [ ] Genetic algorithm utils?
- [ ] Multiple cost functions
- [ ] Maybe multiple optimization methods (not just gradient descent)
- [ ] Thread pool to increase performance

- [x] Forward propagation
- [x] Add bias nodes
